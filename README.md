# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# How to use supabase auth in your supabase instance

NOTE: this guideline assumes you have a supabase instance already set up and running.

1. Go to your supabase instance and navigate to the `Authentication` tab.

2. Click on the `Providers` tab and enable the `Email` provider.

3. Assuming you want custom email domains like "@example.com" to be able to sign up, you need to add a custom smtp server.

**Here's how I did it using TransIP**
- 3.1. First go to supabase.com/dashboard/project/yourprojectid/settings/auth
- 3.2. Scroll down and toggle `Enable custom SMPT`
- 3.3. Go to <a href="https://www.transip.nl/cp/domein-hosting/">transip.nl/cp/domein-hosting</a> and click on the domain u want a custom emailer of.
- 3.4. Click on `Jouw e-mail`, then click on `Algemene instellingen`.
- 3.5. Copy all needed credentials over to the supabase tab.
- 3.6. For the `username` and `password` you need an email user, this'll be used to send supabase's emails.
- 3.7. Go back to `Jouw e-mail` from 3.4 and click on `E-mailboxen` if you have a user go to 3.8.1, if you don't have a user go to 3.8.2.
- 3.8.1. Click on the e-mail user you want and copy credentials.
- 3.8.2. Click on `E-mailbox aanmaken` then follow 3.8.1.

4. After you've added the custom smtp server, you can now use custom email domains.

## NOTE: This project assumes the existance of table Comments in your supabase instance.

```sql
create table
  public."Comment" (
    id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    content text not null default ''::text,
    user_id uuid not null,
    constraint Comment_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint Comment_id_key unique (id),
    constraint Comment_user_id_fkey foreign key (user_id) references auth.users (id) on update cascade on delete cascade
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

Happy coding! ðŸš€
